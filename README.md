# SatelliteTracker

A satellite tracker for radio communications

## Purpose

This project is meant to allow for the downlink of noaa satellites and upload imaging to the internet/database on a budget. With the use of arduino, tv antennas, and stepper motors it will allow for a DIY approach to downlinking from satellites.
